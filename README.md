# Amharic Morphological Segmentation using bidirectional LSTM neural network and rule-based segmentation

Morphological segmentation is the process of breaking down words into their component 
morphemes, which are the smallest units of meaning. This technique is particularly useful in 
morphologically rich languages where words can contain multiple morphemes. Morphological 
segmentation can be performed manually by linguists or automatically using computational 
methods. The primary objective of morphological segmentation is to facilitate the processing of 
natural language. By breaking down words into their component morphemes, it becomes easier to 
analyze and process text data. This can be particularly useful in applications such as information 
retrieval, machine translation, and speech recognition.
Morphological segmentation is especially important for languages with complex morphology, 
such as Amharic, Tigregna and Afan Oromo. In these languages, words can be composed of 
multiple morphemes, and the morphemes can have different forms depending on the context.
Amharic is the most widely spoken Semitic language in the world, primarily spoken in Ethiopia. 
Amharic is a highly inflected language, and its morphological segmentation is challenging. Unlike 
English, where words are usually separated by spaces, Amharic words are typically written as a 
continuous sequence of characters, which makes it difficult to determine word boundaries.
The proposed model development for Amharic morphological segmentation involves combining 
unsupervised deep learning and rule-based segmentation techniques to create a robust and accurate 
system for segmenting words into their constituent morphemes.
